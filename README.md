______________
TO SHOW MODAL
______________

- add class "show_modal" to any <li> item in the <main> content area

- I added the "checkbox hack" to Item 1 to also show the modal. Was a
  bit confused since the description video said it wasn't necessary, but it was
  mentioned in the notes below the video, so I just added it to be safe.
