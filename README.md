______________
TO SHOW MODAL
______________

- add class "show_modal" to any <li> item in the <main> content area

- I didn't add the "checkbox hack" to show modal as well. Was a bit confused
  by this since the description video said it wasn't necessary but it was
  mentioned in the notes below the video. If this is something that needs to be
  added let me know.
